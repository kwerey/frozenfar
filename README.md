# Mapping the Frozenfar

This is a little experiment in making an interactive web map! We are taking a pretty picture of the Icewind Dale section of the D&D world map and making it a little bit interactive - adding markers for notable locations for my lovely tabletop gaming crew's campaign.

It was interesting to learn a tiny bit about the unfamiliar discipline of mapping, so here are some notes.

## Making the map tiles

See `docs/map-tile-setup.md`

## Adding markers

See `docs/leaflet-setup.md`

# To do:

- different icons for different places, depending on purpose/affiliation?
- look into plotting distance between towns - add roads?
